}
Output format: {
Outputs in a specified format
Format: {;[normal/json];}
Options: {
Json: Shows output in prepared json format
Normal: Shows output in prepared normal format
}
Note: Prepared output is in output format section
}
Important: {
All options in settings is not case sensitive
}
}

Note: {
;[options];"type": {
options for arguments formatting (ONLY FOR FORMAT OPTION)
(force user to follow the options or type specified)
;"type";: "type" act as a function to specify specific argument type (example: number, string, boolean) (force user to follow the options) (not case sensitive)
;[options];ï¼š [options] act as a function to list down the functions (/ symbol act as a spliting for multiple options) (force user to follow the options) (not case sensitive)
;<options>;: <options> act as a function to list down the functions (/ symbol act as a spliting for multiple options) (allow user to not follow the options) (not case sensitive)
;?label?;: for naming purpose (users no need to follow this)
;#[argument]#;: act as a function that can accept if the user doesn't have any arguments inside
For example: {
;?books?"number";: force user to follow the "number" type
;?count?[lol/no/idk]: user can choose either lol, no or idk option
;<1/3.141592654>"number";: user can choose either 1 or 3.141592654 but they also can type other numbers
;#;?books?"number";#;: user can choose whether they want to have the books arguments or not
}
}
*[argument]*: act as placeholder of an argument and used to explaination
%[variable name]%: this is a variable
//[comment]//: this is a comment for description purpose (no need to read these)
[title]: {[description]}: functions as a function to make things more tidy and understandable
\[symbol]\: functions as special character or variable escaping (examples to ignore: {
\%\not a variable\%\
\{\hi\}\ (this is not a function for understanding purpose)
\//\hi\//\ (this is not a comment)
)
So, if: {
%book_name% = name of the book
%author% = author of the book
%fiction?% = book is fiction or not (return true/false)
%language% = language of book
%synopsis% = synopsis of the book (depends of language of the book) (Example: if the book is in BM, generate in BM, if the book is in English, generate in English)
%publisher% = publisher of the book
%year% = year of publish
%num% = No. of the book in list
%ln% = placeholder for new line (for spilting)
%type% = book type (refer to main settings)
}
}
Output format: {
Normal: {
Book %num%:
Title: %book_name%
Fiction: %fiction%
Language: %language%
Synopsis: %synopsis%
Author: %author%
Publisher: %publisher%
Year of publish: %year%
Type: %type%
%ln%

Note: Output should be in list form

}
Json: {
\{\"books":\{\"index": %num%, "title": "%book_name%", "fiction": %fiction%, "language": "%language%", "synopsis": %synopsis%, "author": "%author%", "publisher": "%publisher%", "year_of_publish": %year%, "type": "%type%"\}\\}\
Note: {
for json, connect the books to one json string and shouldn't broken halfway
should be in json code block format
}
}
}


Checks: {
Checks to detect issue 
Checks to do: {
Note: {
if all checks passed, continue operation
if one of the checks failed, abort operation
%err% = Where error occured
}
Check format in options in settings is correct or not (if error, output: Oops, seems like there is an error in settings! Error at %err% %ln% Rerun the whole prompt when fixed.)
}
}
